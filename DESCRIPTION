Title: Tools to Encode Visualizations with the 'Grammar of Graphics'-Like 'Vega-Lite' 'Spec'
Version: 0.5.0.9000
Date: 2016-02-28
Author: Bob Rudis (@hrbrmstr)
Maintainer: Bob Rudis <bob@rudis.net>
Description: 'Vega-Lite' provides a higher-level grammar for visual analysis, akin
    to 'ggplot' or 'Tableau', that generates complete 'Vega' specifications. Functions
    exist which enable building a valid 'spec' from scratch or importing a previously
    'spec' file. Functions also exist to export 'spec' files and to generate code
    which will enable plots to be embedded in properly configured web pages. The
    default behavior is to generate an 'htmlwidget'.
