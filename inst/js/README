This is probably obvious, but you need Node installed

You then need browserify installed:

    npm install -g browserify

To handle updates, you need to re-run this command line in a shell from the
inst/js directory:

    browserify in.js > vegalite-bundle.js

And **rebuild the package** so the new js code is in the package.
